/*
    This component is the main component of the contact footer. It renders a list of contact data
    using the ConctactInfo component. The content of the list is located in utils/ContactData.tsx.
    I'm using index as a key for each piece of data as the order of the pieces is fixed and it's not going
    to change, as a result, I don't have to worry about creating a ID property for each section.
    This component behaves similarely to the AboutMe component
