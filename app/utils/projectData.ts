            one of the most well-known banks in the country to migrate their website to a more modern stack.`,

            development of a RESTful API as well as the creation of unit tests.

            numerous concepts including the REST architecture and unit testing. I also gained insight into 
            what it means to be in a working environment, which I consider very valuable.`

            What made this task interesting was the fact that the game needed to be coded in LC-3 Assembly, a language that has
            a very limited set of instructions and only 8 memory registers to work with.`,
            `The limitations of LC-3, combined with its lack of documentation made this assignment 
            a fairly difficult one.  `,

            Even though I hope I never have to code in Assembly again, I have to admit that this project taught me how to 
            break down complex problems and find creative solutions despite strict limitations.`

            the best practices I tried to implement.`,

            was already familiar with about but I also to learnt new tools such as Framer Motion. I reckon it is likely 
            that there are numerous mistakes or areas that could be further optimized. Hopefully as time goes on I will
            improve my skills as a coder and be able to use this website to track my progress.`,
